Week 1: 

Summary: 

We met as a team, reviewed the coursework guidelines, and created a timeline to track tasks and deadlines leading up to the Week 4 deliverable. 

Challenges: 

Coordinating a meeting time to discuss was difficult due to varying schedules. To resolve this, we agreed to meet online during the week and come in early on Fridays for lab work. 

Next Steps: 

Meet next week to discuss potential applications and datasets.

Week 2: 

 Summary: 

We discussed possible applications suggested by each group member, analyzing their pros and cons to shortlist a few. The three application ideas included: 

- Email Spam Classification: Helps users avoid spam emails. 

- Disaster Detection (Hurricanes, Typhoons, Flooding): Aims to predict disaster formation and track its impact, helping implement early warnings. 

- Vehicle License Identification: Categorizes vehicle details for fines and other purposes. 

Challenges: 

Deciding on an application was challenging. Ms. Hend helped by providing insights on the pros and cons, which aided our final choice.

Week 3: 

Summary: 

We examined 2–3 selected datasets, understanding their structure and potential usage. Preprocessing began, using Lab 1–3 as a guide. 

References: 

YouTube videos and ChatGPT. 

Challenges:  

Encountered difficulties in plotting graphs, handling missing values, and preprocessing images. Google Collab and online resources helped clarify these steps. 

  

Next Steps: 

Prepare the presentation slides.

Week 4:  

Summary: 

We focused on dataset preprocessing and visualized data using scatter plots, histograms, correlation matrices, and heatmaps. Image processing involved resizing and adjusting colors to highlight features, using MATLAB with various colormaps. 

Challenges:  

Had questions about the presentation content but clarified them with Ms. Hend. 

 Next Steps: 

Complete and fine-tune the presentation.

Week 5: 

 Summary:   

We practiced clustering and the Bayes classifier through in Lab 4 and Lab 5 and tried implementing it using our preprocessed dataset. 

  

Next Steps:   

Continue working on the labs and complete remaining tasks.
