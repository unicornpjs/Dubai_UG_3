Project Milestones and the timeline
Weeks 1–2: Research and Project Selection
•	Explore various applications for the project before deciding on a suitable application that met all assessment criteria
•	The topic chosen was Predicting and analyzing damage from hurricanes and typoons
•	Finalized two datasets from Kaggle: a numerical dataset for hurricane parameters and an image dataset with satellite visuals of hurricane damage.
•	Defined the project goals and scope.

Weeks 3–4: Understanding the dataset, Preprocessing, and Initial Analysis
•	Numerical DataSet:
o	Explore the structure of the dataset and identify relevant features.
o	Performed preprocessing steps like handling missing values and normalizing data.
o	Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using scatter plots, histograms, correlation matrices, and heatmaps.
•	Image Dataset:
o	Resize images and adjust color channels to highlight features relevant to storm damage.
o	Utilize MATLAB colormaps to enhance image visualization.
•	Deliverable 1:
o	Created and presented the Project Pitch which outlined the goals, datasets, and initial insights.
Weeks 5–10: Model Development and Evaluation
•	Model Training:
o	Trained multiple machine learning models on the preprocessed numerical dataset, including:
	Naïve Bayes
	Clustering algorithms
	Decision Trees
	Linear and Logistic Regression
	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
•	Evaluation:
o	Assessed model performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and RMSE.
o	Fine-tuned hyperparameters to improve results.
•	Integration of Image Processing:
o	Worked on feature extraction from images for damage classification.
o	Combined numerical and image-based insights for a holistic analysis.
